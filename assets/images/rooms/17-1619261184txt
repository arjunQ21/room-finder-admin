hello
9:02 pm

Thank you for the hold time , I see that hosting account is auto renewed on 02/12/21 , actually account expiration date is 2021-02-27, bu as the account was set at auto renewal option, it was renewed  today
And about Addon tool, yes we can reverse and refund the amount for that
But before that let me explain the product features
Domain Privacy is a service that helps to protect your personal information on the internet. ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) requires domain registrars to make contact information available. However, this can also make it easy for spammers and other undesired parties to obtain your personal contact information.
Our Domain Privacy service acts as a shield. Instead of showing the personal contact information (name, address, phone number, and email address) in the public database, the database will show contact information for the Bluehost Domain Privacy service. This allows you to keep your information accurate and up-to-date with our service, as required by ICANN regulations, but keep it blocked from public view
CodeGuard is the daily backup tool, which takes the website backup, and you restore backup using that tool
If you do not wish to use that  Addon tools , I'll cancel and refund the amount, please let me know

Last year's monthly rate was $4.95/month
This year, it has been renewed at $9.99/month

Since there will be less traffic to my site, I would like to go with $4.95/month
Hello
9:11 pm
C
I understand your concern regarding the prices. and the amount which was charged last year was sign up price and renewal price will vary from the sign up price, sign up price is the promotional price that we offer during new account sign up.
But
Yes, I can check with my manger, if we can provide any discounted price on hosting renewal
And for that I need to refund the current renewed hosting amount
If it is okey, shall I proceed with refund?
9:12 pm
A
Is $9.99/month the minimum rate for renewed accounts ?
9:13 pm
C
Yes it depends on the terms, for 12 month actual renewal price is $9.99/month
And if you go with more terms , the price will decreases
9:15 pm
A
Ohh I see
9:15 pm

. Is this correct ?
9:17 pm
C
Yes you are right.
Website will be active till 2021-02-27
9:18 pm
A
Okay
9:18 pm
C
Just to confirm do you want to refund the amount of hosting renewal?
9:19 pm
A
Yes sir.
9:19 pm
C
Sure, just to confirm the amount of hosting renewal that is $119.88, need to refund right?
9:21 pm
A
I would like to refund every purchase from the today's renewal. That makes the total amount to refund $185.63.
9:23 pm
C
Okey, sure, give me 2-3 more minutes
9:24 pm
A
Okay sir. Take your time.
9:25 pm
C
still here, checking with refund amount
9:29 pm
A
Ohh
It took long.
9:31 pm
C
Yes because I'm getting error while processing refund for domain
That is why checking with my manager
and I can able to reverse Total: -$155.76 of hosting renewal and Codeguard Basic, but while reversing domain renewal and domain privacy I get the error

9:34 pm
A
I see.

9:35 pm
C
So for now, shall just reverse $155.76? and remaining amount, I'll try to reverse it once $155.76 is refund is done or else, I need to escalate the case to billing team
For now shall I reverse $155.76? and later I'll try with $17.99 and $11.88, if it doesn't work, I'll escalate the case to billing team , shall I proceed with that?
9:38 pm
A
Can you clarify about how it became $155.76?
I think it should be $185.63-17.99 = $167.64.
Ohh you cannot revert domain privacy too ?
9:39 pm
C
Yes
You will get total refund $185.63
But current I get error while reversing domain and domain privacy
That is why I'm trying to split the amount and refunding it to you, is that okey?
9:40 pm
A
If you cannot revert Domain name registration, its okay for now. The domain name stays.

How long do you think it will take you to revert Domain Privacy too ?
9:41 pm
C
Yes, now I can able to add domain privacy, and refund will be Total: -$167.64, shall I proceed with that?
And domain if needed, I can try to reverse it once this refunded is processed?
